# sqlalchemy-challenge

For this assignment, I used SQLAlchemy to analyze a climate dataset, created a plot graph based on precipitation, and created a histogram based on temperature. I then designed a Flask API based on the climate analysis.

I used past assignments to help me out with this assignment.
